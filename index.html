                <h3>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular<br>
                    than the Taj Mahal? </h3>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent
                    than<br>building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel 
                    than seeing its<br>magnificence up close.<br></p>
                    <br>
                <p> 
                    After all, this is art. Built in Agra,<a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india">India</a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history.
                    And, of course, it’s the<br>perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. 
                    So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal<br>travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, 
                    enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from Destination<br>Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br>
                    <br>
                    Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), 
                    and so<br>much more…

            <h3>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h3>
            <br>
            <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the<br>
                Taj Mahal.<br>
                <br>
                Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people.These include Indian men,<br>
                women and children who may ask to take photos with you.<br>
                <br>
                To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br>
                Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456">8-day Golden Triangle tours</a>

                <br>
                If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from Delhi. <br>
                Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this.

                <br>
                The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally
                prepared, <br>you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…<br>
                <br>
                What to bring to the Taj Mahal<br>
                <br>
                Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but
                it’s best to have <br>minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.<br>
                <br>
                You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:<br>
                <br>
                <li>Passport</li>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Medicine</li>
                <li>Camera</li>
                <li>Phone</li>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="subsec-3">
            <h4>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h4>
            <br>
                <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque,
                    you will <br>need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.<br>
                    <br>
                    It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing
                    and make sure you wear sun<br>screen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter
                    (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br>
                    <br>
                     If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the
                     afternoon to avoid the <br>worst of the heat.<br>
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india"><img src="H-3.jpg" 
                        alt="IMG 3" height="450" width="800"></a><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p><br>

                    <p>Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that
                        are easy to <br>remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the
                        easier they are to slip on and off <br>the better. This actually applies to much of
                        India – shoes with loads of laces are hard!</p><br>
                        
                    <h4>Other things you need to know</h4><br>
                    <p>No food is allowed inside.<br>
                        <br>
                       Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.<br>
                       <br>
                       Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.
                       Photography inside <br>the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics
                       (except cameras and small video cameras) are not allowed.<br>
                       <br>
                       Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area,
                       but keep your wits about <br>you and you won’t need to worry!
                    </p>

        <div class="subsec-4">
            <h4>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds
                (if possible).</p><br>
                <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india"><img src="H-4.jpg" alt="IMG 4" height="450" width="800"></a><br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get
                    an <br>amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a
                    rickshaw to take you <br>there and back cheaply.)<br>
                    <br>
                    And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal
                    monthly (or <br>more!) remain in awe of it. <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/sana-female-intrepid-leader-india/">Sana Jinah,</a> one of the company’s inspiring female
                    tour guides, has some tips <br>on how to do this:<br>
                    <br>
                    "The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So,
                    once I’m done <br>briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There
                    are ways I try to make the <br>experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I
                    say what they are then they will no longer be <br>surprises!
                    The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of<br>
                    the sunlight). It’s so beautiful…<br>
                    <br>
                    She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at
                    sunrise <br>on a clear day.

            <h4>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where
                you sit on <br>the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india"><img src="H-5.jpg" alt="IMG 5" height="450" width="800"></a>
            <br>
            But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles
            worth <br>seeking out.<br>
            <br>
            Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, 
            <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">Pravin Tamang.</a> <br>(His photography is amazing – <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/cities-india-street-photography/">
                check it out</a>!)<br>
            <br>
            <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
            <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main platform</li>
             <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
             <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li> 
             <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li> 
             <br>
             You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal.<br>
             Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility
             earlier in the day <br>and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!

            <h3>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3>
            <br>
            <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet.
                Then <br>explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
                <br>
            <h4>What to do in Agra</h4>
            <br>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra
                Fort is <br>also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi.
                A 16th-century <br>Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.<br>
                <br>
                Despite being located on the <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456">Golden Triangle</a> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than
                in many <br>other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later)
                and you likely <br>won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.
                <br>
                One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by
                (sometimes) <br>taking travelers to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/sheroes-hangout-cafe-is-run-entirely-by-acid-attack-survivors_n_13830342">Sheroes Hangout</a>. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a
                small cafe run entirely by <br>female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are
                employed and tell their stories. It can be <br>confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in
                equal measures.<br>

            <h4>Where to go outside of Agra</h4>
            <br>
            <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. 
                Of these, <br>Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-
            back and <br>has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN
            visit it on <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/delhi-kathmandu-143454">this 15-<br>day trip</a> from <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/nepal/delhi-to-kathmandu">Delhi to Kathmandu</a> (cooking demo and 
            palace visit included!).</p>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india"><img src="H-7.jpg" alt="IMG 7" height="450" width="800"></a><br>
            <br>
            <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/top-colourful-cities/">‘Pink City’</a>, the capital of Rajasthan is
                full of chaos, <br>charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the
                enchanting bazaars, and <br>consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.<br>
                <br>   
                Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’`s
                home to <br>Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown.
                Because of its holy nature, <br>the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on
                this 15-day trip all around Rajasthan.</p>

            <h3>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h3><br>
            <br>
            <p>As you may have <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/taj-mahal-mud-restoration/">read</a> or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very
                thorough clean. <br>Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.<br>
            <br>
            Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-
            white <br>surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The
            work – applying a <br>clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the
            Taj – was carried out by the <br>Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series
            of restorative projects carried out <br>on the historic site.<br>
            <br>
